# Teaching a Robot to Walk (OpenAI Gym)

Almost every single living creature starts it life by learning to walk. In this project I taught a robot to walk in OpenAI's **Bipedal Walker** environment. The descritption can be found [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/). To train the robot I used an nVidia RTX 2070 graphics card which took less than 5 minutes to finish. To try out the model run the Jupyter notebook.
